# Zotero Neo User Guide

This guide documents the current shipped bindings and settings. The default
keymap will change only after the dedicated LazyVim keymap review; consult the
project [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) before relying on planned bindings.

## Modes

The plugin operates in four modes, displayed in a small overlay in the
bottom-right corner of the PDF viewer:

| Mode | Indicator | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Normal** | *(hidden)* | Default — navigation and annotation commands |
| **Cursor** | `-- CURSOR --` | Caret navigation without text selection |
| **Visual** | `-- VISUAL --` | Text selection and annotation creation |
| **Insert** | `-- INSERT --` | Passthrough — all keys go to Zotero |

Mode transitions:

```
Normal ──c──▶ Cursor ──Escape────▶ Normal
Normal ──v──▶ Visual ──v/Escape──▶ Normal
Normal ──i──▶ Insert ──Escape────▶ Normal
Cursor ──v──▶ Visual ──v/Escape──▶ Normal
```

---

## Default keybindings

### Normal mode

#### Scrolling

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` | Scroll down |
| `k` | Scroll up |
| `Shift+h` (`H`) | Scroll left |
| `Shift+l` (`L`) | Scroll right |
| `Ctrl+d` | Half-page down |
| `Ctrl+u` | Half-page up |
| `Ctrl+f` | Full-page down |
| `Ctrl+b` | Full-page up |

Count prefixes multiply the step — `3j` scrolls three steps, `2ctrl+f` two full
pages, and so on.

#### Page navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Previous page |
| `l` | Next page |
| `gg` | First page |
| `G` | Last page |
| `Shift+J` (`J`) | Switch to previous open tab |
| `Shift+K` (`K`) | Switch to next open tab |
| `<space>bj` | Open tab picker (hint-based jump to open tab) |
| `<space>n` | Open notes layout overlay (left: note titles list, right: note preview) |

Count prefixes repeat the page turn (`3l` = three pages forward) and `gg`/`G`
with a count jump to that page number (`5G` / `5gg` = page 5).

#### Reading history

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+o` | Go back through Zotero's native reading history |
| `Ctrl+i` | Go forward through Zotero's native reading history |

History remains owned by Zotero and follows the last active primary or split
reader view. Empty history boundaries are safe no-ops. These bindings are active
only in reader Normal mode; Insert mode and editable controls retain native input.

#### Follow PDF links

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` | Label every visible internal, citation, or external PDF link in the active reader view |

Type the displayed hint letters to activate a link. Matching is case-insensitive;
`Backspace` removes one typed hint character and `Escape` cancels the hint mode.
Internal links, including figure/table references, navigate in the active primary
or split PDF view and become part of Zotero's native `Ctrl+o` / `Ctrl+i` reading
history. Citation hints follow Zotero's first resolved bibliography target.
External links open through Zotero's normal link handler. Reference-preview
overlays, off-screen links, Insert mode, and editable controls are not claimed.

After an internal or citation jump, Neo shows Zotero's preview-style target cue
for about two seconds: a red circle for point destinations or a red rectangle
when the PDF provides an area. The cue is transient and does not create an
annotation or modify text selection.

> **Note:** Zotero's built-in Read Aloud also listens for the `l`/`r` keys.
> The plugin blocks Zotero's reader key forwarding for keys vim consumes, so
> `l` (next page) never starts Read Aloud. To use Read Aloud, press `r`
> (unbound in vim by default) or click the Read Aloud toolbar button.

#### Fuzzy picker

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<space>ff` | Open fuzzy picker over all items in the current library |
| `<space>fb` | Open fuzzy picker over items in the current collection |
| `<space>bj` | Open tab picker (see below) |

The picker opens a search box in the middle of the screen. Start typing to
filter items (sequential fuzzy matching — every character must appear in
order). Then:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` (or `Ctrl+n` / `Ctrl+p`, `Ctrl+j` / `Ctrl+k`) | Move selection up / down |
| `Enter` | Select the item in the item list / jump to the selected tab |
| `Ctrl+o` | Open the selected item's PDF (items picker only) |
| `y` | Copy the selected item's full citation to the clipboard |
| `yy` | Copy the selected item's citekey to the clipboard |
| `Escape` | Close the picker |

The **tab picker** (`<space>bj`) uses the same interface for the currently
open tabs, plus **hint letters**: each tab shows a letter label, and typing
its letter(s) selects that tab directly (single- or double-letter hints
depending on the number of tabs). `y`/`yy` copying is not available in the
tab picker.

#### Notes layout overlay

Left side shows note entries (title only), grouped into Current item notes and All notes.
Right side shows preview content of the currently selected note.
If the current tab is a PDF reader, opening a note from this overlay will
prefer Zotero's right-side note editor so you can read and edit side by side.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move note focus down / up |
| `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` | Fast move down / up in note list |
| `Ctrl+j` / `Ctrl+k` | Switch between current-item notes and all-notes sections in the left list |
| `Ctrl+l` | Move focus to right preview pane |
| `Ctrl+h` | Move focus back to left note list |
| `n` | Create a new child note under the selected note's parent item and open in right-side note editor |
| `Shift+N` | Create a new child note under current selected item and open in a new note tab |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to first / last note in overlay |
| Hint letters | Quick focus by hint label (single or double key) |
| `Enter` | Open selected note in right-side note editor (reader tabs preferred) |
| `Shift+Enter` | Open selected note in a new note tab |
| `Escape` | Close notes layout overlay |

#### Outline explorer

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<space>e` | Toggle custom outline explorer overlay |
| `j` / `k` | Move outline selection down / up |
| `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` | Fast move down / up |
| `l` | Expand selected outline node |
| `h` | Collapse selected outline node |
| `R` / `M` | Expand all / collapse all outline nodes |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to top / bottom outline item |
| Hint letters | Select the hinted outline item without jumping |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected outline entry and return to Normal mode |
| `Escape` | Close the outline explorer |

When the outline explorer opens, it will try to preselect the nearest/current
outline entry for your reading position; if the PDF metadata does not allow
reliable mapping, it falls back to the first visible outline item. Each visible
item also shows a hint label.
If the number of items is small the hints are single characters; otherwise they
expand to two-character hints. Typing a hint only changes the current selection;
you still press `Enter` to jump.

#### Reader split view

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<space>-` | Toggle horizontal split (top/bottom) |
| `<space>\|` | Toggle vertical split (left/right) |
| `Ctrl+h` | Return from the right-side note editor to the active reader pane; otherwise focus the split pane to the left |
| `Ctrl+j` | Focus split pane below (or toggle pane in vertical split) |
| `Ctrl+k` | Focus split pane above (or toggle pane in vertical split) |
| `Ctrl+l` | In vertical split, move to the right reader pane first and then the right-side note editor; otherwise focus the split pane to the right |

#### Marks

Vim-style position marks for quick jumps. `m<x>` sets a mark at the current
viewport position, `` `<x> `` jumps back to it. Mark characters can be `a`–`z`
or `0`–`9` (sioyek-style numbered tags).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `m<x>` | Set a mark at the current position (e.g. `ma`, `m1`) |
| `` `<x> `` | Jump to the mark — instant page flip, reproducing the exact view that was marked (e.g. `` `a ``, `` `1 ``) |
| `dm<x>` | Delete the mark (e.g. `dma`) |
| `dM` | Delete all marks |
| `<space>m` | Toggle the marks explorer overlay (type a mark char to jump directly; `j`/`k` move, `Enter` jump, `d` delete, `x` delete all) |

Notes:

- Digits after a mark prefix are mark characters, not counts — `4j` still
  scrolls four steps, but `` `1 `` jumps to mark 1.
- A mark stores the viewport-centre position: whatever was in the middle of
  the screen when you pressed `m<x>` will be in the middle of the screen when
  you jump back — even mid-page.
- If an annotation is selected (via `[`/`]`), the mark also binds to it so
  follow-up commands (`[`/`]`, `zy`, `y`, …) work after a jump. `[`/`]`
  annotation navigation is unaffected.
- With **Persist marks** enabled (Preferences → Marks) the whole mark set is
  saved as a `zv-marks-<attachmentKey>:` line in the **parent item's Extra
  field** (syncs via Zotero sync — Zotero 9 attachments have no Extra field,
  so the parent item is used; multiple PDFs under one item get separate
  lines), falling back to a device-local pref. The status bar shows which
  backend was used (`· saved (extra)` / `· saved (local)`). Marks from the
  previous annotation-tag scheme are migrated automatically.
- Marks set with persistence disabled live for the current reader session only.

#### Note editor (context pane and standalone note tab)

When a Zotero note editor has focus (right-side context pane or a standalone
note tab), the plugin provides a minimal Vim-like layer.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Enter note Insert mode (pass through typing) |
| `a` / `A` / `I` | Enter Insert mode at next char / line end / line start |
| `o` / `O` | Open line below / above and enter Insert mode |
| `Escape` | Return to note Normal mode |
| `h` / `l` | Move caret left / right |
| `j` / `k` | Move caret down / up line |
| `w` / `e` / `b` | Move by word (forward start / forward end / backward) |
| `W` / `E` / `B` | Big-word variants |
| `0` / `^` / `$` | Move to line start / first non-blank (approx) / line end |
| `gg` | Jump to first line |
| `G` | Jump to last line |
| `3j` (example) | Count prefix for motions (repeat 3 times) |
| `3G` / `12gg` | Count prefix to jump to a specific line number |
| `x` | Delete character at caret |
| `dd` | Delete current line |
| `yy` | Yank current line to clipboard |
| `dw` / `de` / `db` / `d$` | Delete by motion (word/word-end/back-word/to line end) |
| `yw` / `ye` / `yb` / `y$` | Yank by motion |
| `cw` / `ce` / `c$` | Change by motion (delete range and enter Insert mode) |
| `diw` / `yiw` / `ciw` | Inner-word text object (delete/yank/change) |
| `p` / `P` | Paste last yanked/deleted text after / before caret |
| `u` / `Ctrl+r` | Undo / redo bridge |
| `<space>...` | Main-window leader bindings are available in note Normal mode (for example `<space>n`, `<space>ff`) |
| `Shift+J` / `Shift+K` | Switch to previous / next tab from note Normal mode |

`dd`, `yy`, and `x` support count prefixes (for example `3dd`, `5yy`, `4x`).
Operator+motion combos also support counts (for example `3dw`, `2y$`).
`p` and `P` use the plugin's internal note register (updated by `yy` and `dd`).

#### Library tree navigation (left pane)

These bindings act on Zotero's native left pane (collection tree and item
list) when that pane has focus.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move selection down / up (collections tree and item list) |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to the first / last row |
| `h` | In item list, move focus back to collection tree; in collection tree, collapse selected collection or jump to parent |
| `l` | In collection tree, expand selected collection; if already expanded or a leaf, move focus into item list |
| `Enter` | In collection tree, move focus into item list; in item list, open the selected item/PDF |
| `Backspace` | Jump to parent collection |
| `za` | Toggle expand/collapse for the currently selected collection row |
| `zo` | Expand the current collection row (if already open, keep it open) |
| `zc` | Collapse the current collection row (if already closed, keep it closed) |
| `R` | Expand all collections in the current library tree |
| `M` | Collapse all collections in the current library tree |

#### Main window `<space>` chords

These bindings work in the main Zotero window (not inside the reader), on
whatever has focus:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<space>ff` | Fuzzy picker over all items in the current library |
| `<space>fb` | Fuzzy picker over items in the current collection |
| `<space>bj` | Open tab picker |
| `<space>n` | Toggle notes layout overlay |
| `<space>e` | Focus the collection tree |
| `<space>yy` | Copy the selected item's citekey to the clipboard |
| `<space>o` | Open the selected item's PDF |
| `<space>q` | Close the active PDF tab |
| `<space>/` | Focus Zotero's search bar |
| `<space>wh` | Focus the collection tree (left pane) |
| `<space>wl` | Focus the detail pane (right pane) |
| `<space>ww` | Focus the item list (middle pane) |

#### Viewport positioning (like Vim's z commands)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `zt` | Scroll so the current page is at the **top** of the view |
| `zz` | Scroll so the current page is at the **centre** of the view |
| `zb` | Scroll so the current page is at the **bottom** of the view |

#### Search

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Open the PDF find bar |
| `n` | Jump to the next search match |
| `N` | Jump to the previous search match |
| `Escape` | Clear / close search |

Search works like Vim: press `/` to open Zotero's find bar, type your query
(results highlight as you type), then press `Enter` — focus returns to the
PDF automatically and `n` / `N` cycle through the matches while the result
counter stays visible. Press `/` again to reopen the find bar with your
previous query selected. `Escape` closes the find bar and clears the
highlights. Pressing `n` / `N` without an active search shows a hint to
search first.

#### Sidebar filter by colour

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Zy` | Filter sidebar → Yellow annotations only |
| `Zr` | Filter sidebar → Red annotations only |
| `Zg` | Filter sidebar → Green annotations only |
| `Zb` | Filter sidebar → Blue annotations only |
| `Zp` | Filter sidebar → Purple annotations only |
| `Za` | Clear colour filter (show all annotations) |

> **Tip:** `z` (lowercase) acts *on* an annotation (recolour). `Z` (uppercase) acts *on the sidebar view* (filter).

#### Annotation navigation and editing

Use `[` and `]` to move between annotations. The selected annotation is
highlighted in the PDF and scrolled to in the sidebar.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[` | Jump to previous annotation |
| `]` | Jump to next annotation |
| `Enter` | Open the selected annotation's comment field for editing |
| `i` | Enter Insert mode **and** focus the annotation comment field |
| `y` | Copy the annotation's **highlighted text** to the clipboard |
| `yy` | Copy the annotation's **comment text** to the clipboard |
| `dd` | Delete the selected annotation |
| `zy` | Change annotation colour → Yellow |
| `zr` | Change annotation colour → Red |
| `zg` | Change annotation colour → Green |
| `zb` | Change annotation colour → Blue |
| `zp` | Change annotation colour → Purple |

> **Tip:** `y` vs `yy` — the plugin waits up to 800 ms for the second `y`
> before firing the single-`y` action. Typing `yy` quickly always wins.

#### Mode switches

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `v` | Enter Visual mode |
| `c` | Enter Cursor mode |
| `i` | Enter Insert mode |

---

### Cursor mode

Enter Cursor mode with `c` from Normal mode.
After pressing `c`, the plugin shows **hint badges** (yellow letter labels) at
sentence starts across the visible page.  Picking a sentence badge opens
**word-level hints** inside that sentence: the sentence's own badge keeps its
label, so pressing the same label again places the caret exactly at the
sentence start, and every other label places the caret at that word.

#### Hint picking

- Labels are uppercase; you type lowercase keys (matched case-insensitively).
- With more candidates than letters, labels grow to two characters.
- As you type, the consumed letters dim and non-matching badges disappear;
  a complete label — or input that uniquely matches one badge — activates
  immediately.
- `Backspace` removes the last typed letter.  `Escape` returns from word
  hints to sentence hints; another `Escape` exits to Normal mode.

#### Caret movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Move caret down / up by one visual line |
| `h` / `l` | Move caret left / right by one character |
| `w` | Move caret forward by one word |
| `W` | Move caret forward by one WORD (non-whitespace chunk) |
| `b` | Move caret backward by one word |
| `B` | Move caret backward by one WORD (non-whitespace chunk) |
| `0` / `$` | Move caret to line start / line end |
| `2w`, `3b`, ... | Count prefix repeats the motion |

> **Multi-column papers:** text flows column by column — `j` at the bottom
> of a column wraps to the next column's first line on the same page (`k`
> back the other way), then continues into the next page's first column.
> Page headers/footers are treated as decoration and skipped: a caret never
> lands on them, so `j`/`k` cannot stall there.  `0`/`$` stay within the
> column; `h`/`l`/`w`/`b` follow the reading flow across column breaks.

#### Mode switches

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a..z` (hint) | Pick a sentence hint, then a word hint inside it to place the caret |
| `v` | Enter Visual mode from current caret |
| `Escape` | Exit to Normal mode |

---

### Visual mode

Enter Visual mode with `v` from Normal mode.  If there is no existing text
selection, the plugin shows **hint badges** (yellow letter labels) at sentence
starts across the visible page.  Pressing a sentence label opens **word-level
hints** inside that sentence: the sentence's own badge keeps its label, so
pressing the same label again anchors the selection exactly at the sentence
start, while any other label anchors it at that word.  The selection then
grows as you press movement keys.

Hint picking works like Cursor mode: uppercase labels (type lowercase),
two-character labels when needed, typed letters dim while non-matching badges
disappear, `Backspace` steps back, and `Escape` returns from word hints to
sentence hints (then to Normal mode).

#### Selection movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Extend selection down / up by one line |
| `h` / `l` | Extend selection left / right by one character |
| `w` / `b` | Extend selection forward / backward by one word |
| `0` / `$` | Extend selection to line start / line end |
| `)` / `(` | Extend selection to next / previous sentence start |
| `}` / `{` | Extend selection to paragraph end / start |
| `o` | **Swap anchor and focus** — jump to the opposite end of the selection (like Vim's `o` in Visual mode); subsequent movement keys extend from the new end |

#### Creating annotations

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `zy` | Create a **yellow** highlight |
| `zr` | Create a **red** highlight |
| `zg` | Create a **green** highlight |
| `zb` | Create a **blue** highlight |
| `zp` | Create a **purple** highlight |
| `za` | Add a **note** annotation (creates highlight + opens comment editor) |
| `i` | Same as `za` (quick note + enter Insert on comment) |

#### Copying text

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Copy the **current selection** to the clipboard |
| `yy` | Copy the **whole paragraph** containing the selection to the clipboard |
| `#` | Open the find bar and search for the **current selection** |

All copy operations apply Unicode NFKC normalisation (resolves ligatures such
as `ﬁ` → `fi`) and collapse PDF line-break newlines into spaces.

#### Exiting Visual mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `v` | Exit to Normal mode (clears selection) |
| `Escape` | Exit to Normal mode (clears selection) |

---

### Insert mode

In Insert mode every key is passed through to Zotero unchanged.  This is
useful when you need to type into Zotero's own UI elements without the vim
bindings intercepting your keystrokes.

When `i` is pressed in Normal mode while an annotation is selected (via `[`/`]`),
the plugin enters Insert mode and opens **its own comment overlay** over the
PDF — a floating input box rendered inside the PDF view (the only place that
receives the OS keyboard focus, so typing and IME composition work natively).
The annotation's existing comment is pre-filled; the quoted text is shown as
context.  Zotero's own popup is not used at all.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | New line in the comment |
| `Escape` | Save as the official annotation comment and close the overlay → Normal mode |

The comment is also autosaved 2 seconds after the last keystroke, and `visual i`
(add note) opens the same overlay for the newly created annotation.

Zotero's own annotation popup and sidebar comment fields remain fully usable
for mouse editing: clicking into either while the overlay is open saves and
closes the overlay and hands over to the native editor (Escape inside native
editors keeps its Zotero behavior).

> **Note:** if pressing `i` shows a red `✗` status instead, the plugin writes
> detailed diagnostics to `zotero-neo-startup.log` in your Zotero profile directory
> (`%APPDATA%\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\...` on Windows).

---

## Annotation workflow

### Creating a highlight from scratch

1. Press `v` to enter Visual mode.
2. Press the hint label shown at the desired sentence start — optionally
   refine with a second (word-level) label to anchor at an exact word —
   or press `j`/`k` to begin from the current position.
3. Extend the selection with `j`/`k`/`w`/`b`/`)`/`}`/`h`/`l`.
4. Use `o` to jump to the other end of the selection if you need to trim the
   start rather than extend the end.
5. Press `zy`/`zr`/`zg`/`zb`/`zp` to create a coloured highlight, or `za` to
   add a note.

### Navigating and editing existing annotations

1. Press `]` / `[` to move to the next / previous annotation.  The annotation
   is highlighted in the PDF viewer and the sidebar scrolls to its card.
2. Press `y` to copy the highlighted text, `yy` to copy the comment.
3. Press `i` (or `Enter`) to open the comment overlay and type a note.
   The plugin's own floating input box appears over the PDF with the comment
   pre-filled and the highlighted text quoted as context (Zotero's popup is
   not used).  Press `Enter` for a new line, `Escape` to save and return to
   Normal mode.
4. Press `dd` to delete the annotation.

## Customising keybindings

Open **Edit → Preferences** (macOS: **Zotero → Settings**) and navigate to the
**Zotero Neo** tab.

- Every row in the **Keybindings** table maps a *mode + key sequence* to an
  *action*.
- Click the key sequence cell to edit it directly.
- Use lowercase letters.  Prefix with `ctrl+` for Ctrl (or Cmd on macOS).
- Multi-key sequences such as `gg`, `zy`, or `yy` are supported.
- Click **+ Add binding** to add a new row; click **×** to remove one.
- Click **Apply bindings** to save keybinding changes.
- Appearance, highlight colour, mode, marks and scroll settings save automatically on change.
- Note editor Vim mode can be turned on or off independently from the Preferences panel.
- Click **Reset to defaults** to restore all bindings to their defaults.

The preferences pane is registered with a stable pane id, so the panel opens
directly on the last-used section even after a restart, and its dropdowns use
native Zotero `menulist` controls to stay reliable on every open. Init
failures are reported to `zotero-neo-startup.log` in the profile directory with
`[prefs]`-prefixed lines.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Appearance | Auto | Auto follows Zotero's computed Light/Dark palette; Light and Dark force all Neo-owned panels without recolouring PDF pages or annotations |
| Enable Visual mode | on | Allow entering Visual mode with `v` |
| Enable Cursor mode | on | Allow entering Cursor mode with `c` |
| Enable Insert mode | on | Allow entering Insert mode with `i` |
| Note editor Vim mode | on | Enable Vim-style editing in note editors (context pane and note tabs) |
| Scroll mode | Constant-speed scrolling | Step / Constant-speed / Accelerating — only the active mode's parameters are shown |
| Scroll step | 60 px | Pixels scrolled per `j`/`k`/`H`/`L` keypress (step mode; count prefixes like `3j` always use this) |
| Scroll speed | 2000 px/s | Constant hold-scroll speed (constant-speed mode) |
| Smooth initial speed | 2000 px/s | Starting speed for hold-based smooth scrolling (accelerating mode) |
| Smooth max speed | 2000 px/s | Maximum hold-scroll speed (accelerating mode) |
| Smooth acceleration | 2600 px/s² | Speed increase while holding a scroll key (accelerating mode) |
| Smooth deceleration | 4200 px/s² | Speed decrease after key release (accelerating mode) |
| Stop on release | off | If enabled, stop immediately when key is released (accelerating mode) |
| Persist marks | off | Save marks in the parent item's Extra field (`zv-marks-<attachmentKey>`) so they survive restarts and sync |
| Default highlight colour | Yellow | Colour used when no explicit colour key is pressed |

Appearance and scroll settings save automatically on change.

- **Step scrolling** moves instantly by the scroll step per `j`/`k`/`H`/`L` press.
- **Constant-speed scrolling** glides at a fixed speed while a scroll key is
  held and stops immediately on release.
- **Accelerating (trapezoid curve) scrolling** ramps from `initial speed` to
  `max speed` while held, then decelerates after release (unless *stop on
  release* is enabled). With `initial speed` and `max speed` both set to
  `2000`, it behaves like the constant-speed mode with a gentle glide on
  release.
